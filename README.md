# InMood Facial Expression Identification Engine

At the heart of InMood is a cutting-edge facial expression identification engine that revolutionizes music recommendation. Our team developed this technology to provide users with a truly personalized and unique customized experience that goes beyond traditional recommendation strategies. Our engine is powered by a sophisticated convolutional neural network (CNN) algorithm that has been trained on a vast dataset of over 28,000 [facial images](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/astraszab/facial-expression-dataset-image-folders-fer2013) with 7 emotion labels.
 
The aim of InMood is to provide users with a truly personalized and unique experience that goes beyond traditional recommendation strategies. By harnessing the power of facial expressions as potent indicators of emotions, InMood taps into this rich source of information to curate music playlists, video recommendations, potential loved goods, and more that deeply resonate with users on an emotional level.
